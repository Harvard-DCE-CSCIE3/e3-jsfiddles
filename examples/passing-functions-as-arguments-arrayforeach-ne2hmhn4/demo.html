<h3>Functions as arguments</h3>
<div>
    <p>Functions are often passed as arguments to other functions. For an example of why we'd do this, look at the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach"><code>Array.forEach()</code> method</a>. </p>
    <p><code>Array.forEach()</code> accepts a function as its furst argument, and then executes that function once for each element of the array. </p>
    <p>This example will "fix" the capitalization of an array of strings so that only the first letter of each string is capitalized. </p>
    <p>Output will appear below:</p>
</div>
<div id="output"></div>
