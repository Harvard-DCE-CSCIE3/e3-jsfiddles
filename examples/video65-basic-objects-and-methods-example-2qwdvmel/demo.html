<h3>Video6.5 - Basic Objects and Methods Example</h3>

<p>Here we create two objects using object literals. Each one has a printMe() method, which outputs a summary of the object as a string.</p>
<p>On line 42, we have a printObject() function, which accepts an object as a parameter, and if it has a printMe() method, calls it and writes the resulting string to the page.</p>
<p>On lines 52-53 we call printObject() on each of our objects.</p>

<h3>Output:</h3>

<div id="output"></div>
