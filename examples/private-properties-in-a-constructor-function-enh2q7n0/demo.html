<div>
    <p>Notice that on Line 3, we've declared a property using the standard <i>var</i> keyword rather than using <i>this</i>. </p>
    <p>Inside a constructor function, declared functions and variables are private - they are inaccessable from outside. They follow the normal rules of variable scope inside a function that we learned in Week 5. </p>
    <p>In this example, we're setting personRole when we call the object's constructor, and there's no way to change it afterwards.</p>
    <p>On line 27, we appear to be setting personRole. What we're really doing is making a new, public property called personRole. It's entirely unrelated to the personRole variable and doesn't affect the getPersonRole() method. </p>
    <p>Output will appear below:</p>
