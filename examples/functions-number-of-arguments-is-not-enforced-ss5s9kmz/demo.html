<b><p>Number of arguments is not enforced.</p>Open your console to see the output from this code!</b>
<p>Notice that the function declaration on line 4 takes three arguments. In this case, 
we are type-checking to make sure they exist and that they are numbers. </p>
<p>We can call this function and pass any number of arguments.  The first three arguments will be assigned to the three parameters we have provided, and anything else will be ignored. IF we don't provide three arguments, the unused parameters will remain <i>undefined</i></p>
