    <li>Notice the '==' symbol on line 6.  When we're testing  values in an expression, the double equals sign '==' is a comparison operator. It's different from single equals  '=', which assigns values.  Note the difference:
<pre><code>x = 6  // this assigns the value 6 to the variable x
x == 6 // this tests to see if the value of x is 6, and evaluates as <b>true</b> or <b>false</b></code></pre>
      Refer to the textbook, p133-136 for a full explanation of comparison operators. (We'll also cover these in detail in the next Lesson in Canvas)</li>

         In this example, we are checking to see if we need to make the word 'bananas' in our output plural. Note: This is not the most elegant way to do this particular task, but it illustrates a basic conditional.
