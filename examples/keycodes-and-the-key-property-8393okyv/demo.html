<p>This JSFiddle will display the <code>key</code> and <code>code</code> properties of the event object.  </p>
<p>Remember that <code>key</code> represents the printable character, while <code>code</code>
is a fixed value for each physical key on the keyboard. An easy way to see this differnce is to type 
an uppercase letter and then the same lowercase letter. </p>

<div id="keyname">Give focus to the HTML panel (bottom right) and then press any key.</div>
