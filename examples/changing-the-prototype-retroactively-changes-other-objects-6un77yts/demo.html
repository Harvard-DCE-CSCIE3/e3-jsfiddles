    <p>Changing the constructor's prototype affects every object that's ever been created using that constructor. </p><p>
    Notice how in line 14, the call to spiderman.getFullName() fails since there's no method with that name in the spiderman object, or in the Person object. But when I make the same call on line 25, it works.  Adding getFullName() to the Person.prototype object means that it's available to every object I create from Person, in the past or the future.

    <p>We use the try/catch block on lines 13-17 to handle the 'undefined is not a function' error that would break our code on line 14.
