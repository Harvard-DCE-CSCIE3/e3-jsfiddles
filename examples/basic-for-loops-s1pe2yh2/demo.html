<b>Open your console to see the output from this code!</b>
<p>In the first example, we set our three expressions in the <i>for</i> loop.  Remember, they are:
    <ol>
        <li>the initial expression: this is executed once before the loop runs, and typically sets the initial condition for the counter: in this case, setting <i>index</i> equal to 1 </li>
        <li>the test to run before each iteration over the loop: if this evaluates to true, the loop will continue</li>
        <li>executed after each iteration through the loop. In this case we use it to increment <i>index</i> to the next value</li>
    </ol> 
</p>
<p>In the second example, we create an array of names, and use the loop to iterate over the array and output its contents to the console. </p>
<p>How would you modify the second loop so that all of the names are printed on one line? </p>
