<p>Notice that I perform some <i>input validation</i> on line 2 to confirm that the function actually did receive two numbers as arguments before I add them. </p>
<p>In this case, my validation rule is that "if there are not two numeric arguments, don't do anything and return <code>null</code>.  I might code this differently if the valdiation rule was, say, "try to convert all parameters to numbers, and return the sum of those that are numeric."  </p>
<p>Be sure to read the comments in the Javascript code and the console for more information. </p>
