<b><p>Number of arguments can be collected as an Array using the reste operator.</p>
    Open your console to see the output from this code!</b>
<p>Notice the new Array variable <code>numbersToAddArray</code> that's used as the 
function parameter, and preceded by the rest operator <code>...</code>. 
The rest operator causes the aerguments passed into the function to be collected
in the array, which contains all of the arguments passed in the function call, 
in order. </p>
<p>We can call this function and pass any number of arguments, even if there are 
    no parameters in the function definition itself. We iterate over the array, 
    check each element to see if it is or can be converted to a number, and then add 
    it to our sum. </p>
    <p>We should note that there's an <code>arguments</code> array available in a function.
    It's not actually an array, though it has array-like properties. It collects all arguments
    passed to a function, without requiring rest syntax (the <code>...</code>.</p>
