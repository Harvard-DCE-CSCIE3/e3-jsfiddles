<div id="biggest">
    <p><b>Event.target vs Event.currentTarget and Capturing vs. Bubbling</b></p>
    <p>We've added click handlers to every element in this DOM tree. Click on any element to see how events bubble from what you clicked on up to the top-most node. </p>
    <p>Try changing <code>false</code> to <code>true</code> in the call to addEventListener() for <code>#biggest</code> to see what happens when you handle that event while capturing rather than bubbling. (Be sure to click on the Run button in JSfiddle to load your modified code!)</p>
