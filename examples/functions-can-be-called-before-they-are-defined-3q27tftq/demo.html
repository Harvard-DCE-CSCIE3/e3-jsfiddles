<b><p>Declared functions can be used "before" they are declared.</p>Open your console to see the output from this code!</b>
<p>The Javascript engine reads the entire Javascript file before executing any code, and any declared functions are logged at that time.    </p>
<p>This means that you can call a function "before" (on an earlier line of the code) it's declared. </p>
<p>(If you declare a second function with the same name, it will  will replace the prior one.)  </p>
<p>There is something called a <i>function expression</i>, in which an anonymous function is assigned to a variable.
Expression functions <u>are not</u> made available before the code execution reaches them.  (We'll look at these in Week 6, so if that concept is unfamiliar, don't worry about it.)   </p>
