<p>The equality operator converts the operands if they are not of the same type, then applies strict comparison. </p>
<p>
    If either operand is a number or a boolean, the operands are converted to numbers if possible; else if either operand is a string, the string operand is converted to a number if possible. If both operands are objects, then JavaScript compares internal references which are equal when operands refer to the same object in memory.</p>
