<b>Scope - Your Best Friend (when it's not your worst enemy!)</b>
<div>
    <p>Common variable names (such as <code>name</code>) in the global scope are "an accident waiting to happen". So now we create a self-invoking function - an anonymous function that exposes <i>nothing</i> to the global scope.</p>
    <p>It executes immediately, and everything works without variable name collisions. The syntax is a bit funny, though.  </p>
    <p>Output will appear below:</p>
