    <li>There are several things to notice here. The first <i>if</i> statement runs from line 6 to line 16, with its <i>else</i> section from line 16-19.</li>

         Inside the first <i>if</i> block, only if hasBananas is true, we prompt the user for a number (line 8) and then have a new conditional on lines 11-15 to handle that case.   </li>
    <li>You can nest like this as deeply as you need to. Beware to keep your code neat, your indentation consistent, your braces matching, and use comments.  It's easy to get mixed up - a misplaced brace will break your code and can be very hard to locate - so good code hygiene is important! </li>
