<p>This example runs two different ways of getting an element from the document 
    100k times each, and reports the total time in seconds in the console. It's an exercise
    top show that you can often write a test to answer such a question (the question being
    "which way is faster?"). Run the JSFiddle a few times to see if the results are consistent - 
    there will be variations from moment to moment, since other things your computer is 
    doing will impact the running time for this task.
