<h3>NodeTypes</h3>
<div id="attributeNode">Starting with <i>document.body</i>, we'll iterate over the child nodes and output them to the console based on their nodeType. </div>
<!-- This is a comment - it's a node, too. -->
<p>Notice that except for the last one, the text nodes' content is just whitespace - it's the "carriage returns" that separate lines in our HTML code.</p>
<p>In any case, the output shows each child node of <code>document.body</code>. Note that it does not show the nodes that are the children of the children of the body - those that are deeper in the DOM tree. </p>
This text is sitting outside of any tag, and is a child of the 'body' tag itself.
