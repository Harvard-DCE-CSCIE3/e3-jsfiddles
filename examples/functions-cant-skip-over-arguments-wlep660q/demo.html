<b><p>You can't skip over an argument.</p>Open your console to see the output from this code!</b>
<p>Here we have a function that takes three arugments, and assigns them to three parameters.    </p>
<p>While you don't have to pass in three arguments (you might have only one or two), the only way to get a value into the third parameter is to pass three arguments, even if some are undefined.  </p>
