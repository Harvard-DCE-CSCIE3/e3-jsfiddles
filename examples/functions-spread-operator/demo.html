<b><p>The Spread operator.</p>  Open your console to see the output from this code!</b>
<p>The spread offers a ways to separate arrays into individual
variables. It works
with other types of objects as well, but we'll focus on arrays  and function calls 
for the moment</p>
<p>This function adds three items, which are passed in as arguments. We can extract these values from an array in a funtion call using the <code>...</code> <i>spread</i> syntax. </p>
