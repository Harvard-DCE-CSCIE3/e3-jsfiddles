<b><p>Return value or return type is not enforced.</p>Open your console to see the output from this code!</b>
<p>Here we have three cases of handling (or not) handling return values.  </p>
<p>A function may or may not return anything, 
    and if it does, you don't necessarily have to 
    do anything with the return value.</p>
