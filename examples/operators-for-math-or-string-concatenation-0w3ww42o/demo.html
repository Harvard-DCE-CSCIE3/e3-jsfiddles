<p>The standard Mathematical operators ( + - * / ) work as expected when applied to numerical terms.  You can add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers, and use the parenthesis to group operations and control the order of evaluation.  
</p><p>   
    The + operator can also be used to concatencate two strings. 
    The plus sign is the only operator that has any meaning when used with Strings.  For example, you can't subtract strings from each other: 
    <blockquote>("This is my dog" - "dog" <i>does not evaluate to</i> "This is my"!)</blockquote>
</p>
<p>(Trying to do operations other than + on Strings will not result in an error, but the result will be a special Javascript value: NaN (Not a Number). We'll learn more about this later.)</p>
<p><b>Note:</b>You'll have to open the Javascript console to see the output of the Javascript code</p>
