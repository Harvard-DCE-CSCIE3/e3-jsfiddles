<b>Function Naming</b>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li id="firstListItem">Function names can begin with $, _ or a letter (but not a digit)
            <li>Function names can contain letters or numbers or some punctuation
                <li>Javascript operators are not allowed
                    <li>While unicode characters are technically allowed, it's safest to stick to standard ASCII, and avoid punctuation marks other than _ or $</ul>So, let's do an example: <code>$()</code>  That's a totally legal function name. And let's have it get the element with id <code>id</code> and if it exists, return it.
    <p>Output will appear below (which repeats the content of the #firstListItem above):</p>
