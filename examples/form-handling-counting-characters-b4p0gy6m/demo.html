<h3>Counting Characters</h3>
<p>This code listens for keypresses via the keyup event. Note that if we triggered our count on 'keypress' instead, the count would occur before the character was typed in the field, leaving our counter always too low by one. </p>

<form action="#" id="theForm" name="firstForm">Introduce yourself:
    <br>
    <textarea wrap="soft" rows="6" cols="40" name="bio" id="bio"></textarea>
    <br>You're up to <span id="chars"></span> characters.
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
