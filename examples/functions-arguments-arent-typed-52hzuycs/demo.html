<b><p>Arguments have no defined type.</p>  Open your console to see the output from this code!</b>
<p>This function adds two items, which are passed in as arguments. The parameters inside the function (<code>item1</code> and <code>item2</code>) are regular Javascript variables, with no intrinsic <i>type</i>. In this case, we could pass it two strings or two numbers, and it will still do something sensible with them.  </p>
<p>Of course if we passed two arguments that can't be sensibly "added" - say, the window object and a string, we don't know what this function will return. </p>
