<h3>Open the console to see the output of this code!</h3>
<h3>NodeTypes</h3>
<div id="attributeNode">Starting with <i>document.body</i>, we'll iterate over the child nodes and output them  and their nodeType to the console. </div>
<!-- This is a comment - it's a node, too. -->
<p>Well, since we're appending the node object to a string in our console.log() call, what we're outputting is the output of each node's toString() method.  Different browsers will display this differently.</p>
<p>In any case, the output shows each child node of <code>document.body</code>. Note that it does not show the nodes that are the children of the children of the body - those that are deeper in the DOM tree. </p>
