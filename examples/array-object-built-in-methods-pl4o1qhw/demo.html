    <p>The built-in Array object provides some helpful methods for manipulating arrays.</p>
    <p>The way to find out some of what you can do with an array is to look in a reference. As we've seen, there are many references and each can be useful in its own way.  We'll be looking at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_array.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools JS Array Reference</a> for its simplicity, or the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array" target="_blank">MDN Array Reference</a> for its completeness. </p>
