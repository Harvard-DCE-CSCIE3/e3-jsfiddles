<h3>Arrays &amp; Looping</h3>
<h4>4 Tasks for this Practice Set:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>
        Make an Array of strings and assign it to a variable. You may make the strings a list of anything you like and use a variable name of your choice.</li>
    <li>
        Use one of the methods of the Array object to insert a new element to the beginning of your array. Looking through the methods on the Array reference page at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/">W3Schools</a> may be helpful. 
    </li>
    <li>
    Using the Array you made in the previous steps, iterate over its elements and write each one to the console.
    </li>
    <li>
        Loop through the integers from 1 to 100 and write each to the console only if it is odd.
    </li>
</ol>
