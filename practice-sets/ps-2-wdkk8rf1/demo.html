<h4>Practice Set: Basic jQuery</h4>

<p>This assignment will give you practice with some basic jQuery capabilities. There are three tasks in this practice set. Use the jQuery API documentation as needed!  </p>
    <p>
    Your tasks are:</p>
<ol id="tasks">
    <li id="firstItem">Find the items in this list and add a yellow background to them (consider using the .css() method)</li>
    <li id="secondItem">Find the second item in this list (this one!), and write its HTML content to the third item (overwriting the third one's content)
    </li>
    <li id="thirdItem">This one gets overwritten with the content of #2 (the .html() method may be helpful here, for both reading from #2 and overwriting #3)</li>
    <li id="fourthItem">Make this item disappear if you click on it! (the .click() method may be helpful)</li>
</ol>
