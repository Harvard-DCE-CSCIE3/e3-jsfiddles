<h3>HTML5 Video - Make the Play Button work</h3>
<p>This page contains a video with the default control bar hidden.  You can test-play the video by right-clicking on the image and selecting Play.</p>
<p>Your task is to make the play and pause buttons work.  The reference at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_video.asp" target="_blank">w3Schools</a> may be of help, as will the examples in video 13.3 in the course.</p>
<p>You will have to add one line of code to each of the event listener methods in the Javascript to complete this.</p>
