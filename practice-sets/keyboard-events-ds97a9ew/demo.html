<h3>Practice Set, Week 9, Keyboard Events</h3>

<p>
  This page contains a box with a "puck" in it. The javascript contains
  functions that will move the puck in each of four directions. Your task is to
  write an event handler that will respond to the keyboard - specifically, to
  allow the user to use the arrow keys to move the puck around.
</p>
<p>
  You can attach an event handler to the window object, and have a conditional
  to see which key was pressed. The
  content on key events in Week 9, lesson 3 of the course may be helpful to you.
</p>
<p>
  Also, when running your code in JSFiddle, you will have to give this HTML
  output frame focus (by clicking on it once) for your code to capture keyboard
  activity.
</p>
<p>
  Hint - all you have to do is listen for keydown (or keyup), and depending on
  which arrow key was pressed, call the appropriate function.
