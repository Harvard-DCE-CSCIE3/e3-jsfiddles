<h3>Practice Set, Week 9, Keyboard Events</h3>

<p>This page contains a box with a "puck" in it. The javascript contains functions that will move the puck in each of four directions. Your task is to write an event handler that will respond to the keyboard - specifically, to allow the user to use the arrow keys to move the puck around.</p>
<p>You can attach an event handler to the window object, and have a conditional to see which key was pressed. The <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/cscie3/j1uLsvay/">keyCode utility</a> we referred to in Week 9, lesson 3 of the course may be helpful to you.</p>
<p>Also, when running your code in JSFiddle, you will have to give this HTML output frame focus (by clicking on it once) for your code to capture keyboard activity. </p>
<p>Hint - all you have to do is listen for keydown or keyup, and depending on which arrow key was pressed, call the appropriate function. </p>
