<h3>Practice Set: Variable Type conversions: Automatic vs Explicit Conversions</h3>
<h4>There are 2 problems in this practice set</h4>
<ol>
    <li>In the first problem, we meant to have the text below match <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX3kxAA2L4Q" target="_blank">the classic quote from <i>Mr Mom</i> (at 00:15)</a>.  
        <blockquote>
            <span id="twotwenty">220</span>, 
            <span id="twotwentyone"></span>, 
            whatever it takes...
        </blockquote>
        The sentence should read "220, 221, whatever it takes..." <b>You will change the code on line 7 to fix this problem</b> (your solution need not be all on one line)</li> <br>
    <li>In the next problem, we're outputting a phone number to the page. In this case, the number appears incorrectly. <b>You should make a change to line 15 to resolve this.</b> 
        <blockquote>My number is <span id="phonenumber"></span>   </blockquote></li>
</ol>
