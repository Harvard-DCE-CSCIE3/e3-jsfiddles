<h3>Practice Set, Week 8, DOM Traversal</h3>

<p>Code is provided here that will traverse the DOM. Your job is to add some code that will take some action at each node.</p>
<p>Your task is to find every element that has the word "text" in it, and add the className "searchHit" to their parent elements.</p>
<p>The steps to do this will look something like this:</p>
<ol>
    <li>At each node, determine if it's a text node</li>
    <li>If so, find out if the target string is within the text content of the node.</li>
    <li>If so, get the parent node and set its class attribute to "searchHit"</li>
</ol>
<p>If you've got it, each element containing the word 'text' will be highlighted in yellow. </p>
