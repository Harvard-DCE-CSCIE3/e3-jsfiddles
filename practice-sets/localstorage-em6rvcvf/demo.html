<p>There is one part to this practice problem. This exercise is designed to get you comfortable with using <code>window.localStorage</code>, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage" target="_blank">Storage object</a>, and the utilities of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify" target="_blank">JSON object</a>.</p>
<ol>
    <li>On lines 11-12, the <code>personInfo</code> object is being converted into a string using JSON.stringify(), and assigned to localStorage. Your task is to do the opposite: retrieve the string from localStorage (Storage.getItem() may help), and output it to the page using the logMessage() function that's provided. 
    </li>
    <p><b>Output:</b>

    <div id="output"></div>
