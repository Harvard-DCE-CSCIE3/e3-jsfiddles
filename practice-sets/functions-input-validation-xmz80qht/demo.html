<h3>Open the console to see the output from this code</h3>
<p>There are two exercises in this practice set</p>
<ol>
    <li>In the first, you must write the logMessage() function that will make the call on line 6 write the argument to the console. </li>
    <li>In the second, you will add input validation to this function so that the test cases work. If you've done it correctly, test cases 1-3 should output a truncated string (or the original, if the "targetLength" value is greater than the string length or is undefined) , while test cases 4 and 5 will output the string "Invalid Input".</li>
</ol>
