//  YOUR CODE HERE: Use fetch() to make a request to 
//.   https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random

//.   to get body from the Request object as json, and the second
//.   to do actually access the json data


// This code provided fo convenience. Assume you can move this code anywhere you
//   like, including inside one of your .then() functions
const output = document.getElementById("output");
output.innerHTML = '';  // your code here to display the image returned from the API
